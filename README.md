Test Doubles Workshop
=====================

Code used to do the _Test Doubles_ workshop originaly imparted in Calidae.

How To
------
First, install the dependences in your virtual environment with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In every folder you will find a piece of code to understand one test double.
Work inside one, and pass the local tests with `pytest`.

Note that _real code_ and tests are in the same file for simplicity.
